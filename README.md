# SEMS- Smart Energy Management System
This IoT-driven project is designed to optimize energy conservation, enhance operational efficiency, and improve safety within a model room setup. The system incorporates advanced technologies to create an intelligent environment that minimizes energy consumption while focusing on user convenience and safety. Through the integration of sensors and automation, the project ensures that devices operate only when needed, contributing to both energy savings and an efficient living space.

At the heart of the system is an RFID card reader, which controls access to various appliances in the room. Only authorized users are allowed to activate or deactivate the devices, ensuring energy is not wasted when the room is unoccupied. When access is granted, the system uses a motion sensor to activate lights and fans, ensuring they only run when movement is detected in the room. This motion-triggered operation helps reduce unnecessary energy consumption, making the environment more sustainable.

Safety is also a primary focus of the system. A fire sensor is integrated into the setup to detect any emergencies, triggering a buzzer to alert the users. While the system does not send notifications, the audible buzzer ensures that anyone present in the room is immediately aware of the fire hazard. This safety feature provides a prompt response mechanism to address fire-related risks, adding an extra layer of protection for the room's occupants.

The entire system is built on a Raspberry Pi, which acts as the central processing unit for managing the sensors and devices. The project is developed using Python to ensure autonomous operation, with a strong emphasis on integrating hardware and software seamlessly. Collaborative development with teammates was crucial to ensure that the system functions efficiently and reliably, providing both energy conservation and safety in an easy-to-manage package.
