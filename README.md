This IoT-driven project is designed with the goal of optimizing energy conservation, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing safety within a model room environment. By incorporating advanced technologies, the system aims to create an intelligent, responsive ecosystem that minimizes energy waste while prioritizing safety and convenience. The project leverages a variety of sensors and components to ensure that each device in the room operates only when necessary, providing a highly efficient and user-centric solution.

The core functionality of the system revolves around an RFID card reader, which controls access to appliances within the room. Only authorized users are allowed to activate or deactivate devices, ensuring that energy consumption is minimized when not in use. Once access is granted, the system automatically triggers the activation of lights and fans through a motion sensor. This sensor ensures that energy is only consumed when movement is detected, preventing unnecessary power usage when the room is unoccupied.

In addition to energy conservation, the system places a strong emphasis on safety. A fire sensor is integrated into the setup to provide real-time alerts in case of an emergency. This feature adds an extra layer of protection, allowing for prompt responses in critical situations and reducing the risk of potential hazards. The project thus not only serves as an energy-efficient solution but also ensures a safe environment for its users.

The entire system is developed on a Raspberry Pi, which acts as the central hub for processing data and managing interactions between the sensors and devices. The project involves coding in Python to enable autonomous operation, with a focus on seamless integration of hardware and software. Collaborative teamwork played a crucial role in ensuring that the system functions smoothly, with each member contributing their expertise to create a reliable and efficient solution.
